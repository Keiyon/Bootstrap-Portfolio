                            <p class="bigBlue">Hey everyone! My name is Keiyon Tyler and I am going to share with you a portfolio
                                of my current project! So a little bit about me: I was born in Fayetteville, North Carolina
                                and have moved a total of eight times in my life! Something that I like to tell people just
                                to see their facial reaction is that I have NEVER seen Star Wars before in my life. Most
                                of the time people are like, "Wow are you kidding me!" I am at the point in my life now where
                                I can't ever see myself watching it. </p>

                            <p class="bigBlue">I am a very active person. In high school, the two sports that I participated
                                in were wrestling and track. I wrestled for eight years and made it to regionals my sophomore
                                and junior year but I was unable to continue because I tore a labrum and then fully dislocated
                                my right shoulder. Although this injury happened six years ago, I am now into weight lifting.
                                Whenever my friend's see how much stronger I have become, they always wonder what kinds of
                                foods am I consuming considering that I am a vegan. </p>


                        </div>
                        <div class="col-md-12">
                                <p class="bigBlue">I graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University in December 2017 with a degree in Business:
                                    Administration. Although I have a degree, I was not very passionate with the classes that I had to take while
                                    in this field. I knew that it was a sign for me to look for better opportunities, which is why I signed up
                                    for this Bootcamp class. I am having a lot of high expectations for this course as I have heard from a family
                                    friend that she learned a lot from this type of course and that she is finally happy with her current job.</p>
